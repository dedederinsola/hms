# Hostel Management for Crawford Uni

Hello! This hostel management system is modelled after an existing portal. The objectives are to allocate rooms, handle complaints, and sign students out. It has 2 sides.

**Students (studentside)**
1. Get a room allocated automatically.
2. Make a complaint concerning the hostel facilities.
3. Request a non standard room.

**Hostel Officers (adminside)**
1. View all complaints and click a button to resolve them.
2. View historical complaint and occupancy data.
3. Sign Students out of the hostel

The helpful folder is full of code scraps, pictures and test files that i found helpful at some point in the project.

I will be updating this periodically as I improve.
